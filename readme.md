# Women's History Month 2018: Visualising Women's History

For Women's History Month 2018 I plan to produce some visualisations of women's/gender history datasets. I'll primarily be using R, although I'll probably experiment with other tools along the way. 

I'll blog about these experiments at [Early Modern Notes](https://earlymodernnotes.wordpress.com) and I'll post R code and the underlying data here as I go along.

Some of the datasets are likely to be closely related to my research interests and recent projects, but I hope to find new material from various sources.

I've started with these because this is data I recently created and this is my first chance to do something with it!
